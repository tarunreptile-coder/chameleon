# **App Name**: MobileFrame

## Core Features:

- Device Frame Rendering: Render realistic mobile device frames (iPhone 17 Pro and Google Pixel 9 Pro) with fixed dimensions and styling.
- Frame Selector: Implement a button-based frame selector to switch between the iPhone 17 Pro and Google Pixel 9 Pro frames.
- Dashboard UI: Display a Finance or Weather Dashboard inside the mobile device frame with relevant data, a header, cards, and bottom navigation.
- Content Scroll: Ensure the dashboard content inside the frame is scrollable if it exceeds the device's screen height.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#6246EA) to give a sophisticated, modern feel, which is also clearly visible on the dark and light backgrounds.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F4F3F6), nearly white but subtly desaturated to provide a soft backdrop without harshness.
- Accent color: Deep rose (#D11149), selected for contrast, making key interactive elements easily noticeable.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for its modern, clean appearance and excellent readability.
- Simple, outline-style icons for the dashboard and navigation, complementing the clean typography and modern design.
- Centered layout to ensure the mobile frame is visually balanced on screens of varying sizes.
- Subtle transitions when switching between device frames, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.
